From what I learnt in CIT 593, I have some skills and basic knowleage on how to reach the computer system, how the system works from component level and circuit level, and what I want to learn from this class is to deep dive on how to imply what I learnt from thoery and to use it from more practise way to fulfill actial function. In this very beigining class tutorial, I have followed step by step to set up github, terminal in Mac OS, and linked docker and git together. So far what I think the connection is still just linked some software together to better save and update the files, push or pull the file from some sever to local. I have met some difficulties like re-join to home/CIT-595, and to push the file in repository and successfully debug and fix the issues. Feel very happy during this fundmental excercise and want to learn more from the class in the upcoming semester. Thanks in advance!
